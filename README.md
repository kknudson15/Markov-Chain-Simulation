# Markov-Chain-Simulation
The goal of this project was to utilize R to simulate a Markov chain consisting of the states of Sunny, Cloudy and Rainy.  The Probability of a sunny day followed by two cloudy days was determined from this simulation, along with the case that given today was rainy, the probability the sun will shine the day after tomorrow, was calculated.
